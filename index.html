    <p style="margin-right:600px;font-style:normal"> this short film by edwin s. porter features three characters: a man, a woman, and the moon. while the man and the woman dance below the moonlight, the moon takes pleasure in its voyeuristic observation and begins to encroach on the couple. the film ends with the woman fainting into the man’s arms as the moon hangs eerily nearby. </p>

        <p style="font-style:normal;margin-left:540px">the premise of my game builds on these images and behaviors. acting as the moon, the player’s goal would be to navigate towards people below and consume as many of them as possible. these people would be represented in various relationships, as love does not need to be exclusively romantic or sexual. the player could navigate the moon using the left, right, up, and down keys on the keyboard. this action could also be accomplished using a simple controller, which might allow for more mobility. in addition to consuming people, the moon would also need to avoid shooting stars.</p>
